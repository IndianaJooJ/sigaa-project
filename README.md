This project is a better version of my university student website, the original one was made in 2006 and i am mproving somethings like all screen sizes support, better design, better collors, better buttons, better elements, animations and making it clear and more functional;
I don't have the rigths of the website, its just a student trying to make it better, i don't have acces to SIGAA or CEFET servers or nothing like that, i haven't used the original code and everything here i coded from completely zero (u can se by the differences of the two codes);
There are now 05/05/2024 the main branch with a version very similar with the original site and just with the screen size fit features and some animations, and the upgrade branch witch contains the improved version off the site with all features i have think and described before;
Please don't hesitate in tell me thing to improve my code or codding skills;
Thanks for seeing, i hope you enjoy!
